2. be able to answer my teachers question, to test my understanding of the class.

As a teacher, I want to...

1. my question to be secure, so that I am the only one that is able to see them (Strech Goals)

2. present questions to the classes, so that my question can see what I am asking them.

3. to create private quiz rooms so that only my students (or people with the link) can access them

4. see how many people answered the question to be able to monitor the progress of the class.

5. make sure that student cannot answer twice, so that the statistics cannot be falsified

6. be able to access a breakdown of the answers, so that I can monitor the class progress.

7. be able to re-use my questions, so I can ask them to multiples group of students

8. only ask multiple choices questions to the students, to facilitate the reading of statistics
